Conjugation algorithms in different tenses of French in Java

The code provided here may be useful to anyone who needs an idea of how to conjugate different verbs of the French language at different times.

The grammatical times that i have included in the file "AlgoritmoConjugacionFrances.java" are:

- Le conditionnel présent.
- Le passe compose de l'indicatif.
- I introduced you to de l'indicatif.
- L'imparfait de l'indicatif.
- Plus that parfait de l'indicatif.
- Le conditionnel passé.
- Le futur simple.

In the file "Verbs.java" we can find some French verbs in the infinitive, since they are used in some conjugation algorithms for the conjugation of irregular,
regular and action verbs, which I have added to use in the project.
However, you can write by console the verb whose conjugation is required for the subject that is required and in the grammatical time that is desired from those previously mentioned.
